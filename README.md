# Abschlussprojekt
This is my Final Project that im doing for the [ZLI](https://www.zli.ch/). Its a Weather-App that uses a Geolocation API to transform addresses into coordinates and then a Weather API uses these Coordinates to display the current Weather. The Data returned from the Weather API is then saved in a Database.
